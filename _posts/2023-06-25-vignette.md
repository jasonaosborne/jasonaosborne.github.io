## Not a real blog post

This file is entitled \`\`2023-06-25-vignette.Rmd” and is located
locally one step up from the working directory (at “../”).

I am just revisiting the R Markdown Homework that was due 5/25. In
particular, I am following the directions in the file entitled
“HW2-Intstructions.html” that are specific about generating a markdown
file (with extension “\*.md”) from the console, and not by clicking the
knit button. We must supply “github_document” as the value of the
`output_format` parameter/argument to the `render` function:

``` r
library(rmarkdown)
rmarkdown::render("2023-06-25-vignette.Rmd",
                  output_format="github_document",
                  output_file="./_posts/2023-06-25-vignette.md"
                  )
```

Then I will push this file “blobpost-jun25.md” ” document up to the
github repo in the “./\_posts” folder and it should be visible.
