## Programming Background

I have been using SAS for, omg, 30 years, mostly for analyzing data.
I also use R to develop and disseminate statistical methodology.  In particular,
I have written an R package available on CRAN called `hiddenf` and have written
a publication based on a *shiny* app I've written called `MLBDecideR`.

## Including Plots

Here is a plot!

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Here is the render code used to generate the files to make this blogpost visible.
```{r render, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
rmarkdown::render("2023-07-14-ProgBGBlogpost.Rmd",output_format="github_document",output_dir="../_posts/",output_options=list(keep_html=FALSE))
