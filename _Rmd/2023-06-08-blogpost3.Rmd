## My programming experience

In graduate school, I asked my colleague Ed, repeatedly, "Hey Ed, how do you 
do this?"  We saw each other a couple of months ago for the first time in
about 15 years. He was in Chapel Hill for a conference and we had burritos
at Carrburritos.  It was good.

```{r, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
x <- 1:10
y <- 2+x+rnorm(10)
plot(x,y)
```
